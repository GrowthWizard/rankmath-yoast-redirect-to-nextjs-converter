          potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be
          processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a data
          protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be
          guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to
          release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data
          subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in
          court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the
          Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your
          personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these

          For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
          content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the

          program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether
          the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to
          &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in
          the browser line.

        <h3>YouTube with expanded data protection integration</h3>
        <p className="font-montserrat mb-5">
          Our website embeds videos of the website YouTube. The website operator
          is Google Ireland Limited (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;), Gordon House, Barrow
          Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
        </p>
        <p className="font-montserrat mb-5">
          We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to
          YouTube, this mode ensures that YouTube does not store any information
          about visitors to this website before they watch the video.
          Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the sharing of data
          with YouTube partners can be ruled out as a result of the expanded
          data protection mode. For instance, regardless of whether you are
          watching a video, YouTube will always establish a connection with the
          Google DoubleClick network.
        </p>
        <p className="font-montserrat mb-5">
          As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a
          connection to YouTube&rsquo;s servers will be established. As a
          result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you
          have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account while you
          visit our site, you enable YouTube to directly allocate your browsing
          patterns to your personal profile. You have the option to prevent this
          by logging out of your YouTube account.
        </p>
        <p className="font-montserrat mb-5">
          Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be
          able to place various cookies on your device or comparable
          technologies for recognition (e.g. device fingerprinting). In this way
          YouTube will be able to obtain information about this website&rsquo;s
          visitors. Among other things, this information will be used to
          generate video statistics with the aim of improving the user
          friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to commit fraud.
        </p>
        <p className="font-montserrat mb-5">
          Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions
          may be triggered after you have started to play a YouTube video, which
          are beyond our control.
        </p>
        <p className="font-montserrat mb-5">
          The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online
          content in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, this is
          a legitimate interest. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the
          processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a)
          GDPR and &sect; 25 (1) TTDSG, insofar the consent includes the storage
          of cookies or the access to information in the user&rsquo;s end device
          (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG. This
          consent can be revoked at any time.
